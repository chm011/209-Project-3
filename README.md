My dataset is about internet usage across the world from 2000 to 2013. The original data came with footnotes, sources, and continent entries alongside countries, which I had to clean out. This is the same dataset I worked on for Project 2, where I created a line graph to show usage among major countries. This time, I wanted to try a new way to visualize the data and had considered an interactive bar chart or line chart. However, I realized that with so many countries, the visual effect wouldn’t be as effective since users would have to scroll or navigate through a long list. I also wanted to try a map visualization last time but found it hard to portray internet usage well in a static image. An interactive visualization seemed ideal for this project, as it would allow for a global overview and exploration in a way that would be challenging with other formats. A map visualization lets users quickly skim and compare levels of internet usage across countries. Unlike bar charts or line graphs, which work better for tracking changes within a single entity or smaller group, the map enables users to see internet usage on a global scale in one glance.

For the color scale, I went with a blue gradient where the lightest color represents no usage and darker blues indicate closer to 100% internet usage among the population. I considered using a multi-hue color scale, but I felt that might suggest additional comparisons that aren’t actually present in the data. The blue gradient conveys the message more directly/ I also added a side column with a list of all countries, which highlights the corresponding country on the map when users hover over the country name. I think this feature helps users find the country of interest more easily; especially smaller countries that are harder to spot on the map. Finally, I added a slider at the bottom of the country list, allowing users to scroll through years and dynamically update the map to reflect changes in internet usage over time. This gives a sense of progression and allows users to observe trends as they shift by year.

To work with this dataset, I started by cleaning the data using python, saving it as cleaned_internet_data.csv. I then manually filtered out anything that wasn’t a country and saved that file as cleaned_internet_data_countriesonly.csv, which took about 2 hours. Finding a suitable GeoJSON file that aligned well with my data was more challenging and took about 2.5 hours, as I experimented with different options until finding a good fit. Developing the map interactions and writing each function took the most time, around 7 hours, as there were many adjustments needed. For example, the map would often disappear with slight changes to the projection settings, and there were several mismatches between the GeoJSON data and my CSV country list that required me to implement name-matching logic, which required going through the list manually. Finally, I spent another 1.5 hours polishing the final map layout, ensuring the legend, font, and map placement were visually balanced. I worked on this individually, the entire project took around 13 hours in total, which took a couple days to complete. It was quite a challenge.

I think that combining a choropleth map with interactive elements like the slider and hover-highlighting worked nicely for exploring global internet usage patterns over time. In the future, I might consider adding a search feature to make it even easier for users to locate specific countries and perhaps an optional play/pause button for automatically cycling through the years.
